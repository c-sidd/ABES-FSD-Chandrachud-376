        Hi, I’m Chandrachud Siddharth, an aspiring software developer passionate about problem-solving, open-source, and building impactful digital solutions. I’m currently sharpening my skills in C++, Python, Java, DevOps, and web development, with a strong focus on competitive programming and system design.
   <br>
I aim to contribute to open-source communities like GSoC and the Linux Foundation mentorship programs, while growing into a skilled full-stack developer.
<br>
Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving communication skills, and continuously challenging myself to learn and grow. My long-term goal is to combine technical expertise with creativity to build solutions that make a difference.
